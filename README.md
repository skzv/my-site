# My Site

My main homepage.

Hosted at [skz.dev](https://skz.dev).

The aim is to keep things simple. An email link and a link to my blog, above a row of social media links.

The background animation - a sea of oscillating particles, generated with three.js - provides a slick backdrop while alluding to my background in physics.
